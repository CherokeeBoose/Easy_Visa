# Easy_Visa
I built a predictive machine learning model to automate visa approval decisions by analyzing applicant data and identifying key factors that influence approval outcomes.
Course: Advanced Machine Learning
Project Submission Date: July 13, 2025

Summary:
In this project, I built a predictive model to streamline visa approval decisions. Using historical applicant data, I identified the most important features influencing visa status and created an ensemble-based model to support informed recommendations.
Skills & Tools I Used:
	•	EDA – to examine patterns and trends in applicant data
	•	Data Pre-Processing – to prepare the dataset for modeling
	•	Bagging Classifier – to reduce variance and improve stability
	•	Boosting Classifier – to sequentially improve model accuracy
	•	Stacking Classifier – to combine multiple models for better performance
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning – to fine-tune model parameters
	•	Business Insights – to extract meaningful conclusions from model output
